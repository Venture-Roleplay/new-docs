<h3 align="center">Section 2</h3>

<h3 align="center">Chain of Command and Ranking Structure</h3>

#### 2.1 - Chain Of Command

The department of Law Enforcement will be considered a uniform department. The ranks of the police departments will be consistent through out. The rank you are given will be valid in all departments, this creates a flow of the three departments. If you apply for Law Enforcement at Venture RP and you are accepted, you will be granted the Probationary rank and access to all three departments in their respective Probationary positions. (Probationary Trooper, Probationary Officer, Probationary Deputy) 

The Chain of Command (COC) will consist of the following:

Commissioner

Assistant Commissioner

Deputy Commissioner

Department Supervisors (With the option of Field Training Officer (FTO))

Trooper/Officer/Deputy

Probationary

The ranks in the COC signify a level of experience within the department. Following with this comes an authority in some areas. However, who you report to may not necessarily be the next position up. 

For example, a probationary will directly report to a Field training officer. Even though any supervisor has the experience for this duty, you will report to the ones who are FTO certified. They have gone through additional training and gained special access to help you out. Some supervisors may have other duties, hence why they have not opted into this program. 

Note: This does not mean FTOs have authority over other supervisors.

Further explanations based on this topic will be given in the next section.
