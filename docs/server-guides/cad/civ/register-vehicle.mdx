# ðŸš— Registering a Vehicle

## Registering a Vehicle as a Civilian - Venture Roleplay

To register a vehicle on our CAD, go to the [citizen dashboard](https://cad.venturerp.xyz/citizen) and click "Register Vehicle". You will be prompted to enter the vehicle's license plate, model, owner, color, trim levels, and statuses. Once you have entered all of the information, click "Register Vehicle" and the vehicle will be registered to the owner you specified.
