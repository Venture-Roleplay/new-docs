### How to register a weapon

To register a weapon on our CAD, go to the [citizen dashboard](https://cad.venturerp.xyz/citizen) and click "Register Weapon". You will be prompted with a form to fill out the model, owner, and registration status of the weapon. Once you have filled out the form, click "Register Weapon" and your weapon will be registered to the owner you specified.
